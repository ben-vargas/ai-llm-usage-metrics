## Common Issues

### No data found

If the CLI reports no usage data found:

1. Verify the source application has been used
2. Check the data directory location for your platform
3. Use the `--verbose` flag for detailed diagnostics

### Permission errors

Ensure the CLI has read access to application data directories.
