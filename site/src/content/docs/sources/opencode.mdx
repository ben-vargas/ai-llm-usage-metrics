## Data format

- SQLite database

## Path selection

1. explicit `--opencode-db`
2. deterministic OS-specific default candidates

```bash
llm-usage daily --source opencode --opencode-db /path/to/opencode.db
```

## Parsing notes

- database is opened in read-only mode
- assistant message rows are parsed into normalized events
- malformed rows are skipped and surfaced in diagnostics
- busy/locked DB errors use bounded retry before failing with actionable guidance
