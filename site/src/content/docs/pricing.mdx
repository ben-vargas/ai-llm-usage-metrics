description: How pricing is loaded and how row costs are computed.
---

`llm-usage-metrics` uses LiteLLM pricing data to estimate costs when events do not include explicit cost.

## Pricing source

- primary source: LiteLLM pricing JSON
- cache: local pricing cache is used when available
- offline mode: `--pricing-offline` uses cache only

```bash
llm-usage monthly --pricing-offline
```

If pricing cannot be loaded (or offline cache is unavailable), report generation fails.

For cache lifecycle and tuning knobs, see [Caching](/caching/).

## Cost modes

Each event is either:

- `explicit`: source included a valid cost
- `estimated`: cost derived from pricing data

Explicit `costUsd: 0` events are re-priced from LiteLLM when model pricing exists.

## Row cost rendering

- `-` when all contributing events are unresolved
- `~$...` when only part of the row cost is known
- `$...` when row cost is fully resolved

## Override pricing URL

```bash
llm-usage monthly --pricing-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json
```
